                <p> Welcome! I am a 1st AD based in East London. I have worked as an AD across continents, collaborating
                    with brands in Italy, the UAE, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find a full list of my brand collaborations and AD work below: they range from the
                    Roundhouse in London, to the Cineteca di Bologna in Italy, to the Abu Dhabi Media Company in the
                    UAE.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently open to new work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Organised. I keep everything on track while making sure creativity has the space it needs to thrive.
                    I have managed schedules for teams of over 50 people without a hitch. Every film I have AD-ed has
                    wrapped up early, and with satisfied creative teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inclusive. I have been an LGBT activist since I was fifteen, as an Arab lesbian myself. I have
                    worked in anti-racist advocacy, and I am trained in disability inclusion. My work is about listening
                    to the needs of everyone on set and making sure every crew member is valued and motivated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Passionate. I love being part of this industry. I have taught film, studied film, and made films
                    over the last eight years. Films are the most powerful tool for inspiring and connecting people: my
                    commitment to this field is unwavering.
